# STAT430-Group-Project-

Sound Processing with Neural Networks and the FMA dataset. 

## Proposal and Significance 

We will start by classifying a subset of the dataset linked above using outputs such as the language and/or genre of song. If time allows, our stretch goal would be to train a recommendation model, potentially based off of the paper and classification methods we developed earlier. This would be akin to using a subset of “liked songs” to recommend more songs. The project is similar to recognition and recommendation features from apps like Shazam and Spotify, which aligns with our interests in audio processing and music and whether or not it is possible to expand or improve upon existing recommendation systems.
